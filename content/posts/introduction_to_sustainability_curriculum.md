# How to approach teaching sustainability, with a focus on high school students.


Imagine for a moment that you have the reasoning capacity way beyond that of any other species on your planet.

You have been able solve any physical problem or technical challenge imaginable.  
To the point that you had almost instantaneous access to more information than you could ever take in in a hundred lifetimes, and you could communicate with anyone else anywhere else on the planet on a whim.

Your kind had managed learn about the most incomprehensible things, from the most basic particles that make up everything, to the origins of the universe itself.

Your ancestors had even been exploring the universe through ever more sophisticated means, for hundreds of years.
Many of you have traveled to space, some just for fun!

Then imagine that it is discovered that this is the only planet within the known universe that even supports life, let alone the miraculous abundance and diversity that lead to the evolution of your species.

How do you imagine a species with this sort of talent and knowledge would behave?  How would they treat each other and there uniquely abundant planet?

What would you want to do with with this knowledge, if were one of them?
