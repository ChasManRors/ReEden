Our Perverse Obsession With 'Win-Lose' Over 'Win-Win'.  This has been especially discordant during this holiday season.
<!--more-->


Everywhere I look, I see the failure of the idea that someone else has to "lose" for someone else to "win".
And, if I look beyond the news of the day, I see examples of what happens when a 'win-win' approach is tried.

The rise to prominence of those who have insatiable appetites for power, money and attention is driving much of the world's foreign, domestic and environmental policies.  The Climate Change Conference in Dubai was one of the latest examples of just how horribly wrong even our best efforts can go, when narrow self-interest takes over.  It might as well have been an OPEC meeting, given how well the petroleum industry was represented (as it has been in the past).

Whether it's destroying the environment of the only planet that sustains us (have you seen pictures of Mars?), waging genocidal war on a neighboring country, or making products with intentional flaws, the same mentality is at play.  The collective good is not the priority.

At the same time, as individuals, we regularly do things for each other.  Whether it's giving a stranger directions, or doing disaster relief, sometimes traveling at some expense and risking injury to do it.

Those who reach out to help others tend to live happier and more fulfilled lives, while it is the rare billionaire who is truly happy.

Why do some of the 'smartest' people do things that don't really make there lives better, and risk the future for there own offspring along with the rest?

We used to take pride in making some of the most durable and repairable products, stocking parts to make those repairs.  Our quality machinery was sought after around the world.  Some made in places like Bridgeport, CT, became an indispensable part of all machine shops.  Then the urge to squeeze more short term profits brought us "Value Engineering" and "Planned Obsolescence".  This thinly disguised and successful attempt to pick our pockets has crept into almost every corner of industry.  From kitchen appliances through automobiles to airplanes, the push to get more profit for a worse product has become the norm.  The push to make it harder to repair the things, and design in failure, has created the perception that anything old needs to be replaced, regardless of how easy it might be to repair.  We now have a generation that for the most part doesn't have the skills or inclination to repair anything.  The ever escalating quest for "profits" is largely just an annoyance when it comes to consumer goods, but can turn deadly in other areas.  Whether it's power generation, food safety, transportation, or any number of other large scale industries who's products and services we can't resist, the quest for short term gain has lead to a lot of long term suffering.  One recent and well publicized example was Boeing's 737 Max.  The 'bean counters' who replace the engineers at the helm of Boeing tried to solve a hardware problem with a software patch.  They pushed the envelope of weight and balance in a way that even beginner student pilots are trained to avoid.  This brings up the subject of oversight, and the coziness of regulators with the regulated...

Media has played a role in keeping us unsettled and divided, with the goal of selling more ads.  Good news is boring, and doesn't inspire us to try to treat our anxiety with a purchase.  Examples of how things can go right don't tend to make national news, as much as they might give us a constructive path forward.  There is much to be learned from individuals, communities, companies and countries that are quietly trying to make life better.  We have never needed to shine a light on them more than at this pivotal moment for our planet.

In this world of deep disfunction, I hope that your holidays were filled with connection and meaning, filled with gifts home-made, regifted or lovingly restored antiques.  And that your gatherings be filled the joy and merriment that only possible when all electronics are turned off.
May your New Year bring the sort of community that can only come from finding common ground with those from different backgrounds and perspectives.

In this New Year, let us seek to hold those in power accountable, or replace them, if that's not possible.
May our gift to our children and grandchildren be a path to a sustainable future.
