It was built at great expense by the insecure and arrogant king Gustav Vasa, who no one dared tell it was unstable.  It sunk within a half hour of launch, to great fanfare.  

Like the Vasa, many of our biggest failures as humans have been predictable, and also perpetrated by those with great wealth and power, often in the pursuit of more wealth and power.  
Failures both large and small can often be easily been prevented by some combination of:
*Good planning. Taking the time to think things through, and then careful execution of the project,
*Team effort. A more open and less hierarchical process, where input from even the lowest on the totem pole feel free to give input,
*And, studying the past.  History, and those with long experience are often the untapped resources that could have averted disaster. 
We are not doomed to repeat history, we are just very good at it...
