*Media & Political Literacy*

In this section, we are exploring the intersection of Sustainability with Media & Politics.
<!--more-->
This is not meant to be proscriptive, or promote one "side" over another, but to take a hard look at motives and conduct of our public discourse, how that effects various levels of governance, and then the resulting effects on environmental policy. 
With the increasing divisiveness all around the world, driven by those desiring power and/or attention, this section will inevitably inspire some level of consternation.  A mix of complaints and compliments from many quarters will be taken as a sign that we got it right. 

In examining why certain stories get a lot of airplay, and others don't, and the perspective (or"spin") given to those stories, we must first look at what inspires the authors, and then the editorial/algorithmic decisions that follow.
* The most familiar driver is, of course, ad revenue. 
This has led to "news" programing that favors the dramatic but inconsequential, over the consequential and therefore possibly controversial.  Covering the "car crashes" but not the context.  Or covering the riots, but not the peaceful protests, and certainly not the serious issues behind it.   (As true today with social media as it has always been of commercial broadcasters.)
* Political and social agendas are sometimes overtly obvious, and other times subtle or bizarrely convoluted.  Among the most toxic methods are character assassination and creating division.  Divide and conquer is a tried and true ploy, especially effective with those who are not sufficiently informed or socially integrated with their communities. 
* The saddest of motivations to publish or share content is the search for popularity or notoriety.  The desire for attention has driven many to do the most embarrassing and sometimes dangerous things.  Whether it is foolish stunts on social media (making the platform tons of ad money), or spreading dramatic but unsubstantiated narratives that are too interesting to resist (also making the platform profitable).  

Often we find some combination of the above, along with some real journalism, perhaps as the original intent, or to give a sense of legitimacy.  

If one is interested in a true understanding of the world, a critical reading (hearing or watching) of everything is essential.  The best defense is as deep a background in things you know to be true, and consideration of the motives of the source.  It is often the case that one source may have a useful perspective on some subjects, and be biased on others, or may change over time, due to changes in ownership or some other factors.
Look for what seems true (and then you might research it), what seems spun or false, and what is missing (critical details, and, most likely, context).  Two things that separates the best reporters from all others are, a clear curiosity or open-mindedness on the subject, and listing the sources of the information.  (Wikipedia is generally a good example.)

A recent example was the remarkable choice of half the major networks to not air a major policy speech by a sitting President of the US, using the excuse that it might be too "political", while having little to no hesitation to the circus that was the campaign of the Republican winner of the 2015 presidential nomination.
