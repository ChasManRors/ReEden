**This site is dedicated to the idea that humans can actually live in harmony with each other and with the rest of the planet, despite all evidence to the contrary.**

The hope is that in exploring the content and links, you along with many others will be inspired to dream, and then to act, with the goal of realizing this fantastic idea.
Many came before us who have inspired and informed us.  Many more are now working to get us back to a sustainable relationship with our planet/home. You can find out about some of them in the articles and links, and can let us know about others [here]()

We are also exploring the idea of a demonstration project to test out some ideas of how we might live in a way that is both sustainable and resilient.
[Follow progress], or [get involved]
